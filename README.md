# Seam Carving

Seam carving is a method image resizing that targets "seams" of pixels in an image that are determined to be of least interest or importance. Seam removal allows for image resizing that does not compromise the content of the image itself.

Video demonstration of original implementation is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NcIJXTlugc). This repository showcases my own attempt.
